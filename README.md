# Poloniex-Loans
An old script for Google Scripts to access Poloniex loan data. 

I started by opening an Excel Spreadsheetm and created 2 sheets inside. 
A google script is created seperately and the Web url of the spreadsheet is used in the script to link the script with the spreadsheet. 
The script is not created from the spreadsheet so the linkage is not automatic. 

The first Sheet is named "APIPULL" and it is referenced in the script code. The other sheet is for collecting past data and plotting charts. Its name does not matter.
